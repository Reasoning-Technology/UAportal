    It is possible to get the cursor in the div but before input field on our forms.  We should fix that.
    I tried getting rid of the div, and just putting style on the input tag, that seemed to make things
    worse.

    easy way to do this: it tab to get to the next field

    After hitting 'add record' go to a page that says 'record added'  delay, then go back to the root
    menu.  Right now it goes directly back.

    Something like this:
