Initially two groups: staff ,photographers.  staff may add photographers and
refugees.  Photographers may scan QR codes to add to the phototaken table.  We
use an 'actions' field to know if we are adding edited or delete info to the
table.  I.e. these groups only add to the tables even when deleting, thus
there is a full audit record.
